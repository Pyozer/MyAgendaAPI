# Why the probable end of the application?

The application was created in 2016 and has evolved a lot since then.
Then the motivation was less present, because I no longer used the application myself.

From November 2022, the application started to cost me around â‚¬5 per month.
Indeed, the application uses an API also developed by myself, which is used to retrieve events and which is hosted on Heroku (free before 2022).

The application brings me absolutely nothing, because it is free, without ads and no donations, but costs me each month.

I have been preparing an update for some time now to no longer use the API (among others), but on the iOS side it is published on a friend's account.
Which is not practical and complicated to update it.

On Android, this new update has been published.

Having an Apple developer account costs $99 per year, or ~$8 per month.
This is a solution I am considering, because it would allow me to be able to publish other applications.

But on the iOS side, the application will probably be discontinued on September 1st.
