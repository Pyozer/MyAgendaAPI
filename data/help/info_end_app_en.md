# Why the end of the application?

The application was created in 2016 and has evolved a lot since then.
Then the motivation was less present because I no longer used the application myself.

From November 2022, the application started to cost me around â‚¬5 per month.
Indeed, the application uses an API also developed by myself, which is used to retrieve events and which is hosted on Heroku (free before 2022).

The application brings me absolutely nothing because it is free, without ads and no donations, but costs me every month.

I have been preparing an update for some time now to no longer use the API (among other things), but on the iOS side it is published on a friend's account.
Which is not practical and complicated to update.

Having an Apple developer account costs $99 per year, or ~$8 per month.
Which I don't want either.

That's why I decided to stop the application.

If any developer wants to take it over to maintain it, don't hesitate to contact me.
