# Alternative solutions to UnivAgenda

Here are some alternative applications to replace UnivAgenda:

## Apple Calendar

You can add the export link of your calendar to your Apple calendar.
It will be linked to your account, and therefore visible on your iPhone, iPad, MAC, etc.

Adding from your iPhone:
- Open the Calendar application on your iPhone/iPad
- Tap on "Calendars"
- Then "Add a calendar"
- Choose "Add a calendar with subscription"
- Paste the link of your calendar and click on "Subscribe"

You can also add from your Macbook (not useful, if already added from your iPhone).
To do this, open the calendar, then file -> Calendar subscription.

You will now have access to your university calendar on your Apple calendar.
The courses are updated automatically.

## Google Calendar

Google Calendar also allows you to import an external calendar.

**Warning**, having tested it, the courses do not seem to be updated regularly.
So if a course is updated, you may not see it.

If you still want to continue, here are the steps:

- Open Google Calendar on your computer
- The application does not allow adding, but only viewing
- Click on the small "+" on the left of the screen, right next to "Other calendars"
- Choose "From URL"
- Paste the link to your calendar and validate by clicking on "Add a calendar"

The courses will then be imported into your Google calendar and visible on your PC and on the Google Calendar application.

## One Calendar

This application also allows you to add a calendar from a URL.

To do this:

- When launching, choose the visual theme that suits you
- Then select as account type: "WebCal (subscription, URL, ICS, Webcal URL)"
- Paste the link of your calendar

If however the URL of your calendar is not in HTTPS:

- Go back until you have the calendar (empty)
- Go to the settings of the One Calendar application
- Then Security
- Finally, uncheck "HTTPS only"

Then go back to "Accounts" and add your link

## TimeCalendar

This application allows you to do essentially the same thing as UnivAgenda.

To add your university calendar, follow the steps of the application.

It is possible to add the link of your calendar directly.

## Others

With Outlook, it is also possible to add a calendar from a URL

Other apps exist on the stores, by searching for example: "EDT", "ICS Calendar url", etc..
