# Where can I find the export link for my calendar?

To use UnivAgenda and be able to see your calendar, you must enter the export link for it.
A very large majority of ENTs, whether linked to a University or a private school, they offer to export your agenda as a link.

For ENTs from universities in France, generally you have to go to the bottom left of your calendar, a button to export should be there. You must then generate a link for the ICS format.

In addition to the export link, ENTs (usually) generate a QRCode. This can be flashed directly from the UnivAgenda application in order to facilitate entry.

Here are some methods to grab the link:

- ENT from your computer, flash the QRCode with the application
- ENT from your phone, copy and paste the link into the application
- ENT from your computer, copy and paste the link into Google Keep, in order to have it then on your phone (there are other synchronized notes solutions, Google Keep being an example)
