# Where can I find the export link for my diary?

In order to use UnivAgenda and view your agenda, you need to enter the export link of your agenda.

You should not use the direct link to your schedule, but a generated link which you must obtain.

The vast majority of ENTs, whether linked to a University or a private school, offer to export your agenda as a link.

For the ENTs of the universities in France, generally you have to go to the bottom left of your agenda, a button to export should be there. You then need to generate a link for the ICS/Ical format.

Some ENTs (e.g. Rennes) are displayed incorrectly on mobile phones and the export button may not be displayed.
I therefore advise you to be on a computer to export your agenda.
Moreover, I also advise you before exporting, to select another group on your schedule, to re-select yours and only then to export.

In addition to the export link, the ENTs (usually) generate a QRCode. This can be flashed directly from the UnivAgenda application for easy input.

Here are some methods to enter the link:

- ENT from your computer, flash the QRCode with the application.
- ENT from your phone, copy and paste the link into the application
- ENT from your computer, copy and paste the link into Google Keep, in order to have it on your phone (there are other synchronised note solutions, Google Keep being an example).

To help you, here are some screenshots to generate the link / get the qrcode :
